 Build our final website for the semester

This website is going to be one where you can go and look at books and find what ones you want to read next. There are options to browes different pages and see more books or like books you want to come back to.

There is so many time where people are looking for a new book to read and not knowing what to read or where to start to look for somthing to read. This website is going to have many books people can add to so there is many different types of books.

In this time building this website I have learned a lot of tips and tricks for making someone be able to right the code for the website faster. In my time making this I have learned that when adding photos if you need to resize them all you can leave the file in the code put the photos in photo shop resize them and hit save and it will change the size of them right on the website
